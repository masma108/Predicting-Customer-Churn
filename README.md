 # Predicting Customer Churn

  **One Sentence Summary:** This project uses machine learning to predict which bank customers are likely to leave, using a dataset from the Kaggle playground series.

 ## Overview

 This project addresses the challenge of predicting customer churn, which involves determining which customers will stop using a bank's services. The approach taken involves analyzing a dataset with customer information, including demographics, account details, and service usage. The RandomForestClassifier model was employed to learn from this data, and it was able to predict customer churn with reasonable accuracy, identifying key factors that contribute to customers leaving the bank.

 ## Summary of Workdone

 ### Data

 The data used in this project is in CSV format and contains a mix of numerical features, such as age and balance, and categorical features, like gender and geography. The output is a binary flag indicating whether a customer churned or not. The data was split into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the model.

 #### Preprocessing / Clean up

 The data was checked for missing values, and there were none. Categorical features, specifically "Geography" and "Gender," were one-hot encoded to convert them into a numerical format suitable for the machine learning model.

 #### Data Visualization

 Histograms were used to see how different features (like age or balance) looked for customers who left versus those who stayed. We also used count plots to look at the relationship between categories and churn. A correlation matrix helped us see how different numerical features relate to each other.

 ### Problem Formulation

 The problem is formulated such that the input to the model is a set of customer features, both numerical and categorical, and the output is a prediction of whether a customer will churn (1) or not (0). The RandomForestClassifier model was used for this classification task. The key hyperparameters for RandomForest, such as the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the trees, and the number of features considered when splitting a node, were set to their default values.

 ### Training

 The RandomForestClassifier model was trained using scikit-learn. The training time was relatively quick, taking only a few seconds. The model is built by aggregating the results of many decision trees, and training was stopped after the trees were grown. No significant difficulties were encountered during training.

 ### Performance Comparison

 The key performance metric used was accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly classified customers, whether they churned or not. The model achieved an accuracy of 81% on the test set.

 ### Conclusions

 The Random Forest model worked well in predicting churn. Some features, like account balance and customer activity, seemed more important in predicting who would leave.

 ### Future Work

 Further exploration could involve trying other machine learning models, to see if the performance can be improved.  More advanced feature engineering, such as creating new features or transforming existing ones, could also be explored. Analyzing the impact of different hyperparameter settings for the RandomForestClassifier could lead to better results.
